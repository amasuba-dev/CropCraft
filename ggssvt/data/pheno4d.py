"""Pheno4D, as the reference geometry this project has never had.

Schunck et al., *Pheno4D: a spatio-temporal dataset of maize and tomato plant
point clouds for phenotyping and advanced plant analysis*, PLOS ONE 2021.
Seven maize and seven tomato plants, laser-scanned over two to three weeks, with
roughly 260 million points hand-labelled at organ level.

**Why it matters here.** Every reconstruction claim in this project rests on the
implied bulk density criterion, because no laser scan of our own specimens
exists and correctness therefore cannot be measured directly. §7f goes further
and argues that silhouette IoU ranks our reconstructions *backwards* -- an
argument that currently rests on the density screen disagreeing with the metric,
which is an inference rather than a demonstration.

A Pheno4D cloud is a plant whose true shape is known. Render virtual views of it
at our azimuths and camera model, run our carve and our fusion on those views,
and the reconstruction can be scored against the truth directly. The density
criterion can then be checked rather than defended, and the metric inversion
shown rather than inferred.

**The format**, from the files themselves rather than from the paper: whitespace-
separated text, millimetres, one point per line. Files ending ``_a`` carry two
extra integer columns -- a semantic label where 0 is soil, 1 is stem and 2 and
above are individual leaves, and an instance label. Files without the suffix are
the same scans unlabelled. The soil points sit at z about 0, so the scanner's
frame already has its origin on the ground plane, which is this dataset's
equivalent of our measured pot rim.

**One caveat that shapes the whole experiment.** A laser scan is a *surface*, not
a solid. At our 12 mm voxels that distinction mostly vanishes -- a maize leaf is
well under a millimetre thick, so the voxels a leaf passes through are the plant
-- but it is why the truth here is an occupancy grid built from the points and
not a filled volume. A visual hull's excess over that grid is not a defect of the
comparison; it is the envelope error §7f is about, finally measurable.
