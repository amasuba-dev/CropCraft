"""Baselines GG-SSVT has to beat.

Three of them, chosen to isolate what the method claims:

``VolumeAllometric``
    Mass regressed on carved above-ground volume alone, in log-log space --
    the classical allometric form. If GG-SSVT cannot beat this, the learned
    parts are contributing nothing over the geometry that produced them.

``GeometricFeatures``
    Ridge regression on hand-crafted shape descriptors from the same carved
    volume: volume, height, spread, compactness and so on. This is the
    reconstruct-then-regress pipeline used in the predecessor work on this rig,
    and it is the honest comparator for "does a learned volumetric
    representation beat hand-designed features on the same reconstruction?".

``Direct2D``
    Mass from image statistics only -- silhouette area, depth spread, apparent
    height -- with no 3D reconstruction at all. This is the comparator research
    question 3 needs: does reconstructing geometry actually improve biomass
    estimation over predicting straight from pixels?

All three are fitted with the same leave-one-out protocol as the model, so the
numbers are directly comparable. Every model here is closed-form, so LOOCV over
thirty specimens costs milliseconds and there is no excuse for reporting a
baseline fitted on the full set.
