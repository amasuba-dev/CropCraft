"""Assemble everything the research dashboard needs into one JSON payload.

One pass over the caches produces the whole page: voxel clouds for the 3D
viewer, per-specimen quality and mesh diagnostics, the method comparison, and
the leave-one-out predictions behind the scatter plot.

The horizontal slices the page shows are *not* precomputed. The voxel cloud is
already embedded for the 3D view, and slicing it in the browser costs nothing,
so shipping slice images as well would double the payload to show the same
information twice.
