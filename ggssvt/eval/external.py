"""External validation: does the regression transfer off our own 36 specimens?

Our biomass numbers cannot answer the question they were built for. FINDINGS 7l
shows why: predicting mass from a specimen's capture batch alone beats every
method we have, so a leave-one-out score on our data measures how separable the
capture sessions were, not how well geometry predicts mass. No re-analysis fixes
that, and there will be no further capture.

This runs the same question on somebody else's plants. The 4TU greenhouse lettuce
set is 388 destructively harvested plants across four cultivars and a seven-week
growth series, so its mass range is continuous by construction rather than
clustered into sessions -- 1.4 g to 459.7 g with nothing missing in between.

**Three things are reported, in this order, and the order matters.**

1. *Does the measurement work at all.* Their Height, Diameter and LeafArea were
   measured destructively on the same plants, so the depth-derived versions can
   be correlated against them before anything is regressed. A pipeline whose
   diameter does not track a ruler has no business predicting mass.

2. *Which plants to screen out.* The same discipline the rest of the project
   uses: a criterion fixed in advance, applied before the regression, reported
   with the count it costs. Here it is agreement with the measured diameter,
   because a segmentation that fails produces a diameter that disagrees.

3. *Then the regression*, under leave-one-out and under leave-one-cultivar-out.
   The second is this dataset's analogue of leave-one-batch-out: it asks whether
   the fit survives a cultivar it has never seen, which is the transfer question
   an operational deployment actually faces.

Only the image-only half of our pipeline can run here -- one top-down view means
no carve and no fusion. That is not a limitation dodged: `direct 2D` and
`2D + profile` are the two methods that currently win on our own data, so what is
being tested externally is what is being claimed.
