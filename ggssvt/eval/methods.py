"""Which reconstruction methods the project page can show, and why.

The page used to offer a two-way toggle labelled "segmenter", because the only
two things it could show were the geometric carve and the SAM3D one. That framing
was too narrow. What the toggle actually selects is *where the occupancy field
came from*, and there are more answers to that than two.

Three kinds of entry live here.

**Segmentation variants.** Same twelve views, same carve, different subject mask.
Geometric and SAM3D.

**Reconstruction operators.** Same views, same masks, a different way of turning
them into occupancy. TSDF fusion is here, held at the carve's own 128^3 and 12 mm
precisely so the comparison isolates the operator rather than the grid.

**Sampling variants.** Same carve, fewer views. These are already built by the
view-count ablation and they belong on the page because the ablation's finding is
visual before it is numerical: at four views the hull balloons to something the
size of a wardrobe, and reading that off a table is far less convincing than
rotating it.

**Pose-free reconstructions.** DUSt3R, MASt3R and Fast3R estimate cameras and
geometry from images alone, so they share no failure mode with the carve. They
are declared here but produce no cache until the GPU run happens, and entries
whose cache is missing are simply skipped.

`UNSUPPORTED` records what cannot go on the page and why, so the question does
not have to be re-answered each time it comes up.
