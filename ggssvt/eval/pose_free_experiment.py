"""The pose-free comparison: registration agreement first, biomass second.

Two experiments, and the order matters.

**Registration agreement** is the one worth running even if the biomass numbers
come out useless. Every pose in this project is estimated from depth, and the
azimuth refinement saturates its search bound on almost every specimen, so the
registration is the least verified assumption in the pipeline. A pose-free
method shares no failure mode with it, so the residual after similarity
alignment is a genuine measurement of how wrong the poses are. Nothing else
available produces that number.

**Biomass from the pose-free reconstruction** slots into the same leave-one-out
comparison as every other method, so it is directly comparable. It carries a
caveat the others do not: DUSt3R and Fast3R return arbitrary scale, so their
volumes depend on the scale recovered from the Kinect depth. That makes them only
partly independent of the existing pipeline. MASt3R's metric checkpoint avoids it
and is the one to trust.
