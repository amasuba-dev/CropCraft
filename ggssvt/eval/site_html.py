"""The project page, in the Nerfies template's layout.

Adapted from https://github.com/nerfies/nerfies.github.io (CC BY-SA 4.0). The
template's licence asks for a link back, which the footer carries.

Why that template and not something bespoke: it is the layout an academic reader
already knows how to scan, title, authors, a row of links, teaser, abstract,
then method and results, so nothing about the page needs learning before the
content does. It is also plain: Bulma's defaults, two Google fonts, black
buttons, white ground. Restraint is the point.

Output is a directory rather than one file, because that is what gets pushed to
GitHub Pages:

    site/
      index.html
      static/css/bulma.min.css
      static/css/site.css
      static/images/contact_sheet.png

The specimen payload stays inline in ``index.html``. It is base64 zlib and the
page is useless without it, so splitting it out would only add a fetch that can
fail under ``file://``.

Font Awesome is deliberately absent. The template loads it as 1.4 MB of
icons-via-JavaScript for what amounts to four glyphs; those are inlined as SVG
instead.

          <p>
            The question is whether the feed-forward pointmap family of reconstruction
            models, DUSt3R, MASt3R and Fast3R, improves both the accuracy of biomass
            estimation and what can be said about plant morphology from it. Answering that
            needs a reconstruction baseline to measure against, and most of what follows is
            the finding that the obvious baseline, space carving, is the wrong instrument.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thirty-eight potted plants, Eucalyptus saplings and Mango seedlings, were captured with two Kinect v2 units carried through six positions, giving twelve
            registered RGB-D views each. No calibration target was ever recorded, so every camera
            pose here is estimated from the depth data itself. Space carving turns those views
            into a 128&sup3; occupancy field, from which volume, height and shape descriptors are
            read and regressed against weighed above-ground mass.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first result is a measurement rather than a comparison. Dividing each weighed
            mass by its reconstructed above-ground volume gives an implied bulk density, which
            can be checked against physics: fresh plant tissue runs 300&ndash;900&nbsp;kg/m&sup3;.
            Only <strong>__PLAUSIBLE__ of __N__</strong> carved specimens land inside a
            deliberately generous 200&ndash;1000 band. Most fall far below it, because a visual
            hull encloses the air between leaves and branches. What is being measured is the
            canopy envelope, not the plant, and that is a property of silhouette carving rather
            than of resolution: the hull is the maximal solid consistent with the silhouettes,
            so finer voxels give a smoother envelope and never a gap.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second follows from it. The same twelve depth maps, integrated as a signed
            distance field instead of intersected as silhouette cones, put <strong>21 of 36</strong>
            reconstructions inside the band at the identical grid, and 31 at the resolution the
            sensor actually supports. Holding the features, the protocol, the grid, the views and
            the masks fixed and changing only that operator moves biomass RMSE from
            <strong>0.544 to 0.335&nbsp;kg</strong>, R&sup2; from +0.030 to +0.632, with a paired
            bootstrap of &minus;0.209 [&minus;0.363, &minus;0.066]. It is the first resolved
            improvement here, and it says the reconstruction was the bottleneck rather than the
            regressor.

      The five panels are not five parallel methods, and the row reads left to
      right for a reason. <strong>Segmentation is the shared input</strong>: the
      subject masks and their depth from twelve views, back-projected into the
      world. Everything to its right consumes that and nothing else.
      <strong>Silhouette carving and depth fusion are two genuinely different
      operators</strong> on it, and they differ in what they are willing to
      assume: carving keeps a voxel unless enough cameras vote it away, so it
      fills the space between leaves and comes out too large, while fusion only
      accepts surface the depth sensor actually returned. <strong>The mesh is not
      a third operator</strong>. It is marching cubes over the carve, so it is the
      same object drawn as a shell rather than a solid and can never contain
      anything the carve discarded, which is why its panel reaches the same
      height. <strong>The surface count, after
      <a href="#ledger">Nombambela (2025)</a>, is the fifth</strong>: no carving
      and no distance field, just the occupied voxels the measured surface passes
      through at 7 mm, from four of the same twelve views. At twelve views it
      would be the first panel counted differently, which is the clearest
      statement of what that operator is.
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      They share one camera, one voxel grid and one vertical scale, so a
      reconstruction that reaches lower is drawn lower. Each panel gives the
      estimate produced by the method that consumes that stage, except the
      surface count, which has no fitted regressor here and reports its implied
      bulk density and whether that clears the screen. Pick a specimen and drag
      any panel to turn all of them. Shift-scroll or the buttons zoom; a plain

        Every camera pose here is estimated from depth, and the azimuth refinement saturates its

        DUSt3R, MASt3R and Fast3R estimate cameras <em>and</em> geometry from images alone, so
