"""Every stage of one specimen's reconstruction, in one frame, for the page.

The pipeline runs segmentation, then carving, then fusion, then meshing, and
until now each stage could only be inspected on its own. That hides the thing
that matters most about this dataset: on 17 of 36 specimens the segmentation
reaches most of a metre higher than the carve does (§7r). Reading that as two
numbers in a table takes an act of imagination. Seeing the plant in one panel and
the stump beside it does not.

All five stages are encoded onto the same voxel grid and in the same byte format
the specimen viewer already decodes, so the page gains a panel rather than a
renderer, and the four are directly comparable because they share a frame.

**These are not five parallel methods, and the panels have to say so.** Reading
them left to right as a sequence of equals is the natural mistake and it is
wrong in two places at once.

The segmentation is the *shared input*: the subject masks from all twelve views
with their depth, back-projected into the world. Nothing to its right sees the
raw frames; they all consume this.

Carving and fusion are two genuinely *alternative operators* on that input, and
they differ in what they will assume about space no camera resolved. Carving
keeps a voxel unless enough views vote it away, so it fills the gaps between
leaves and overestimates. Fusion integrates a truncated signed distance field
from the same depth, so it only accepts surface the sensor returned.

The mesh is *not* a third operator. It is marching cubes over the carve's own
occupancy, so it is the same object drawn as a shell rather than a solid. It
can never contain anything the carve discarded, which is why the two panels
reach the same height on every specimen, and why treating a mesh result as
independent evidence would be double counting.

The surface count is the fifth, and the sharpest way to state what it is: it
back-projects the same masks with the same function the segmentation panel uses
and counts occupied voxels, differing only in view count and grid pitch. At
twelve views it would be the first panel counted differently. There is no
carving and no distance field, so it cannot fill a gap it never observed, and
its volume scales with how many views you give it (§7t).

**Point budgets are deliberate.** The segmentation of one Mango runs past 300,000
points and the page embeds every specimen, so each stage is capped. The cap costs
detail and not shape, and the alternative is a page too heavy to open.
