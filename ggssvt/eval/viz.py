"""One configurable entry point for looking at anything in the pipeline.

Until now the visualisation surface was scattered: `gallery` drew contact sheets
and PLY files, `visualise` drew rig and mask overlays, `mesh --export` wrote OBJ,
and each had its own flags. Wanting to see one specimen's segmentation next to
its reconstruction at a size suitable for a figure meant three commands and a
mental note about which one took `--columns`.

This is the pyplot-shaped alternative: a config object holding every knob, and
one call that renders whichever layers were asked for. The config is the API, so
adding a knob does not mean adding a flag to four commands.

    render("M001", VizConfig(layers=("rgb", "segmentation", "occupancy"),
                             size=400, view_index=3))

**On colormaps.** Only perceptually uniform ramps are offered, plus greys. Jet
and rainbow are not, deliberately: they invent structure that is not in the data
by putting sharp luminance edges at arbitrary values, and a depth-cued plant
projection is exactly the kind of image where a reader would mistake that for a
boundary. Greyscale is included because a printed thesis is often read in it, and
a figure that only works in colour is a figure that fails at the viva.

**On backends.** PIL is the default and needs nothing beyond what the project
already installs. Matplotlib is offered for interactive 3D inspection, where
rotating a point cloud is worth more than any static projection, and is imported
only when asked for so it stays optional.
