"""Interchangeable appearance backbones: none, DINOv2, DINOv3.

Box 3 of the system diagram is a DINO vision transformer feeding the 3D feature
volume. This module makes that box swappable so the contribution of the
self-supervised foundation backbone can be measured rather than assumed:

``cnn``
    No DINO. A patch-embedding stem trained from scratch on the RGB-D frames.
    This is the control condition -- it is the *only* one that sees depth and
    validity directly, so it is not a strawman, it is the geometry-only model.

``dinov2``
    DINOv2 patch tokens (Oquab et al., 2023). Open weights.

``dinov3``
    DINOv3 patch tokens. **Gated on HuggingFace**: Meta requires a manual access
    request and licence acceptance per account. Until that is granted, loading
    raises with instructions rather than failing obscurely.

All three expose the same contract::

    tokens = backbone(rgb, depth, valid)     # (N, C, grid_h, grid_w)
    backbone.grid_size(height, width)        # -> (grid_h, grid_w)

Every DINO backbone is frozen by default. With twenty-eight labelled specimens
there is no prospect of fine-tuning 21M+ parameters without memorising the set,
and a frozen backbone is what makes the label-efficiency claim meaningful in the
first place.

Because a frozen RGB backbone cannot ingest depth, the DINO variants embed depth
and validity through a small parallel stem and add it to the DINO tokens. That
keeps the appearance prior intact while the geometry still reaches the encoder,
and it keeps the comparison fair -- every condition sees the same information.
