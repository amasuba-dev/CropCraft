We report that for potted Eucalyptus and Mango the reconstruction step, not the regressor, is the limiting component, and that the standard choice of reconstruction operator is unsound for these morphologies."),
  p("Thirty-eight specimens were captured with two Kinect v2 units carried through six positions, giving twelve registered RGB-D views each; no calibration target was recorded, so all camera poses are estimated from depth. We introduce a physical plausibility diagnostic: dividing weighed shoot mass by reconstructed above-ground volume yields an implied bulk density that can be checked against the 300 to 900 kg per cubic metre of fresh plant tissue. Under space carving, only 8 of 36 usable specimens fall inside a deliberately generous 200 to 1000 band, and all ten Mango specimens imply 26 to 77. The visual hull is the maximal solid consistent with the silhouettes, so this is a property of the operator rather than of resolution."),
  p("Replacing silhouette intersection with truncated signed distance fusion of the same depth maps, holding features, protocol, grid, views and masks fixed, raises the count to 25 of 36 at the identical 12 mm grid and 31 of 36 at the 6 mm the sensor supports. Biomass root-mean-square error falls from 0.544 to 0.335 kg and the coefficient of determination rises from +0.030 to +0.632, a paired-bootstrap difference of -0.209 kg with a 95 per cent interval of -0.363 to -0.066. An image-only control is unchanged at 0.469 kg. Two allometric laws that sat below the mean-predictor floor on the hull clear it on the fusion."),

const introduction = [
  h1("1. Introduction"),
  p("Above-ground biomass is among the most-requested traits in plant phenotyping, and destructive harvest remains the reference method. Non-destructive alternatives estimate it from imaging, and the dominant pipeline is reconstruct-then-regress: recover a three-dimensional representation of the plant, summarise it with shape descriptors, and fit those descriptors to weighed mass. Reviews of high-throughput phenotyping treat plant height and biomass as the principal geometric traits and report biomass estimated from crop surface and crop height models with coefficients of determination between 0.55 and 0.79 for field crops [1]."),
  p("That pipeline has a component that is rarely interrogated. Given silhouettes from a ring of viewpoints, the natural reconstruction is space carving, whose output is the visual hull. Laurentini established that the visual hull is the maximal object consistent with a set of silhouettes [2]: any concavity that casts no silhouette from any viewpoint is filled. For a compact object this is a mild approximation. For a plant, whose above-ground structure is mostly the space between leaves, it is not obvious that it is an approximation at all."),
  p("This paper reports what happens when that assumption is tested rather than inherited. Our contributions are: (i) a physical plausibility diagnostic that checks a reconstruction against the density of the material it claims to represent, independent of any regression; (ii) evidence that space carving fails that check for 28 of 36 specimens and that the failure is a property of the operator; (iii) a controlled substitution of truncated signed distance fusion for silhouette intersection that produces the first statistically resolved improvement in biomass accuracy in this work; and (iv) a set of negative and withdrawn results reported in full, including a claim from an earlier stage of this project that did not survive re-examination."),

  p("Feng and colleagues survey unmanned-aerial phenotyping and organise it by trait, with plant height the most-studied geometric quantity and biomass estimated from height models, vegetation indices, or their combination [1]. That review also defines plant density in its agronomic sense, plants per unit area, which is a stand-level count and distinct from the volumetric density used as a diagnostic here. Amaducci and colleagues report for hemp that plant density affects stem biometry and fibre quality more than it affects biomass yield, and that biomass response is flat across a wide range of planting densities [3]. Both are useful reminders that the agronomic literature's density is not the physical one."),
  p("Acquisition frequency has been studied directly. Bresolin and colleagues report that the optimal image-acquisition frequency for a phenotype is phenotype-specific rather than universal [4]. Our view-count ablation reproduces that conclusion in a different modality and, notably, with the ordering that spectral bandwidth alone would not predict."),
  h2("2.2 Reconstruction operators"),
  p("Silhouette-based reconstruction is bounded above by the visual hull [2]. Volumetric range-image integration provides a different operator: Curless and Levoy accumulate signed distances from depth measurements into a truncated field whose zero crossing is the surface [5], and KinectFusion demonstrated the approach in real time with commodity depth sensors [6]. Marching cubes extracts a surface from the resulting field [7]. The distinction that matters here is evidential. A silhouette constrains the subject to lie somewhere along a ray; a depth sample asserts a surface at a specific distance. Only the second can represent a concavity."),
  h2("2.3 Learned and feed-forward reconstruction"),
  p("DeepVoxels introduced a persistent three-dimensional feature grid optimised over many observations of a single object [8], a lineage continued by neural radiance fields [9] and by three-dimensional Gaussian splatting [10]. These require view counts far beyond the twelve available here and, in the case of DeepVoxels, output novel-view colour rather than geometry, so they are positioned in this work as related architecture rather than as comparators."),
  p("The feed-forward pointmap family is more directly relevant. DUSt3R regresses pointmaps for image pairs without known camera parameters [11]; MASt3R adds metric grounding and matching [12]; Fast3R processes many views in a single pass [13]. Because these estimate cameras from images alone, they share no failure mode with a pipeline whose poses are estimated from the same depth it reconstructs, which makes them the natural independent check on the calibration-free registration used here."),
  h2("2.4 Foundation features and segmentation"),
  p("Self-supervised vision transformers provide general-purpose dense features without labels [14], and promptable segmentation provides subject masks without per-species training [15].

Two Kinect v2 units mounted opposite one another were carried through six positions 30 degrees apart, giving twelve azimuths per specimen. Colour is mapped into the depth frame by the driver, so both streams are 512 by 424 and pixel aligned. Above-ground shoots were cut and weighed fresh."),
  p("Pot mass was estimated for the first three batches and measured directly for V001 to V008 by weighing each pot after shoot removal. Comparing the two on those eight specimens gives a ratio of estimated to measured pot mass of 0.891 with a standard deviation of 0.018, a systematic 10.9 per cent under-estimate with very little scatter. Because net shoot mass is the difference of two large numbers, this propagates to roughly a 24 per cent overstatement of net mass for E001 to E010, where the pot dominates the total. All results below use as-recorded values; the calibration is reported so the uncertainty can be carried."),
  h2("3.2 Calibration-free registration"),
  p("No ChArUco sequence was captured, so camera extrinsics are estimated from the depth data. A RANSAC floor plane per view fixes tilt, roll and height; the subject axis, selected by cross-view agreement, fixes the origin; azimuth is refined by coordinate descent within a plus or minus 8 degree bound. That bound saturates on 25 of 30 specimens in the original batches, which makes registration the least verified assumption in the pipeline and motivates the pose-free check described in Section 6."),

TSDF fusion (Figure 2) integrates each depth sample as a signed distance with a three-voxel truncation band, and takes as interior those voxels lying behind an observed surface and within the truncation. Voxels no camera measured remain unknown rather than being assumed solid, so coverage is reported alongside volume; mean coverage is 0.12. A second fusion at 256-cubed and 6 mm is also reported, that being two depth samples across at the 1.1 m working distance, where one depth pixel spans 3.0 mm."),

Fresh above-ground plant tissue lies in the region of 300 to 900 kg per cubic metre. We adopt a deliberately generous 200 to 1000 band and classify each specimen as plausible, envelope (implied density far below the band, indicating enclosed air) or missing (far above, indicating unreconstructed material). The band edges are conventions; what the diagnostic supports is the direction and the order of magnitude, not a grading."),

The V001 to V008 batch was collected specifically to break this, spanning 500 to 1800 g and therefore overlapping both existing clusters rather than forming a third. It reduces the batch-only figure to 0.744 across the three Eucalyptus batches and 0.697 across all four. Any comparison on this dataset is therefore partly a measurement of size-class separation, and we recommend that within-species results be reported alongside pooled ones."),

    "Twelve views leave most leaf undersides unobserved. Mean fused coverage is 0.12, so roughly one eighth of the working volume was ever measured. Fusion escapes the visual hull's ceiling; it does not substitute for a dense photogrammetric capture.",
    "The fused interior is a band one truncation width deep behind each observed surface, not a filled solid, so its volume is a proxy rather than the plant's volume.",
    "Camera poses are estimated, not measured, and the azimuth refinement saturates its search bound on most specimens.",
    "The target is as-collected fresh mass, which carries water-content variance that no geometry can explain. Oven-dry biomass would be the stronger target.",
    "Pot mass is measured for eight specimens and estimated for the remaining twenty-eight, with a quantified 10.9 per cent bias on the estimates.",

First, the pose-free pointmap models [11, 12, 13] estimate cameras from images alone and therefore share no failure mode with a pipeline whose poses come from the depth it reconstructs. If implied densities remain low under independently estimated poses, the envelope argument closes and can no longer be answered by questioning the registration."),
