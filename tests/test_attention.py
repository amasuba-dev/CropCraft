"""Attention capture, and the guarantees that make it safe to leave in.

The weights are (B, heads, N, N) with N the token count across twelve views, so
capturing them unconditionally would be a real memory cost during training. The
properties worth pinning are therefore about when capture is *off*, not only
that it works when on.
