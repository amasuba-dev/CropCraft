"""Closing the reconstruction-to-segmentation loop.

The property that matters here is not that the rules work. It is that the
comparison is honest: a re-carve of the *unchanged* masks has to reproduce the
cached volume, or every number measures the difference between two carvers
rather than the effect under test. That is not hypothetical. Skipping the
largest-connected-component step made E001 look like all three rules rescued it,
when the control alone moved the volume further than any rule did.
